    <h2>Midterm -- Spring Break By the Beach<br> Cammy Wan</h2>
    <p>My theme is spring break by the beach. I divided the canvas in three equal parts,<br>
        the top is clouds which changes color and sizes whenever you refresh the page, and I used three ellipse to create each cloud. <br>
    The middle part is waves, it changes color and size as well, for this I used several arcs to creat each wave pattern.<br>
    The bottom part is the beach or the sand, light yellow color represents the sand and it changes color.</p>
