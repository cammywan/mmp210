    <h2>Week 10 - Final Project Description<br> Cammy Wan</h2>
    <p>My final project will be mainly focus on the animation andnits interaction with the mouse. There will be about 16 circles with different but similiar style of colors, centering around the mouse and will move as the mouse, as the picture shows. And they will rotate by themselves with the center of the mouse as well. When mouse is clicked, the colors of the circles will change, and maybe as well as the background canva color.When mouse is prseed, the rotation will stiop and size of the circles and the mouse will get slightly but notably bigger.</p>
